PyTorch was hard. Or so I thought. Here you can find various types of code written in PyTorch (add a ranging from).

1. [Training a classifier][1] - Training a CIFAR10 image classifier.
2. [PyTorch Basics][2] - Basics of Pytorch, including loading datasets, training them, creating checkpoints, etc.
3. [Linear Regression][3] - Vanilla Linear Regression in PyTorch
