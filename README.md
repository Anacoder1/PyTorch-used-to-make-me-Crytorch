# PyTorch-used-to-make-me-Crytorch
PyTorch was hard. Or so I thought. Here you can find various types of code written in PyTorch (add a ranging from).

1. [Training a classifier][1] - Training a CIFAR10 image classifier.
2. [PyTorch Basics][2] - Basics of Pytorch, including loading datasets, training them, creating checkpoints, etc.
3. [Linear Regression][3] - Vanilla Linear Regression in PyTorch
4. [Logistic Regression][4] - Performing Logistic Regression on the MNIST dataset
5. [Feedforward Neural Network][5] - A fully connected neural network with one hidden layer, applied to the MNIST dataset
6. [Convolutional Neural Network][6] - A CNN with 2 convolutional layers, demonstrated on the MNIST dataset
7. [Deep Residual Network][7] - A Deep Residual Network (using a ResNet), used on the CIFAR-10 dataset
8. [Recurrent Neural Network][8] - Training a many-to-one RNN on the MNIST dataset
9. [Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network][9] - A Bidirectional many-to-one RNN, applied to the MNIST dataset
